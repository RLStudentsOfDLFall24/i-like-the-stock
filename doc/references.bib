	abstract = {Financial markets are an intriguing place that offer investors the potential to gain large profits if timed correctly. Unfortunately, the dynamic, non-linear nature of financial markets makes it extremely hard to predict future price movements. Within the US stock exchange, there are a countless number of factors that play a role in the price of a company's stock, including but not limited to financial statements, social and news sentiment, overall market sentiment, political happenings and trading psychology. Correlating these factors is virtually impossible for a human. Therefore, we propose STST, a novel approach using a Spatiotemporal Transformer-LSTM model for stock movement prediction. Our model obtains accuracies of 63.707 and 56.879 percent against the ACL18 and KDD17 datasets, respectively. In addition, our model was used in simulation to determine its real-life applicability. It obtained a minimum of 10.41\% higher profit than the S\&P500 stock index, with a minimum annualized return of 31.24\%.},

	abstract = {Time series prediction has been studied for decades due to its potential in a wide range of applications. As one of the most popular technical indicators, moving average summarizes the overall changing patterns over a past period and is frequently used to predict the future trend of time series. However, traditional moving average indicators are calculated by averaging the time series data with equal or predefined weights, and ignore the subtle difference in the importance of different time steps. Moreover, unchanged data weights will be applied across different time series, regardless of the differences in their inherent characteristics. In addition, the interaction between different dimensions of different indicators is ignored when using the moving averages of different scales to predict future trends. In this paper, we propose a learning-based moving average indicator, called the self-attentive moving average (SAMA). After encoding the input signals of time series based on recurrent neural networks, we introduce the self-attention mechanism to adaptively determine the data weights at different time steps for calculating the moving average. Furthermore, we use multiple self-attention heads to model the SAMA indicators of different scales, and finally combine them through a bilinear fusion network for time series prediction. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The data and codes of our work have been released.},

	abstract = {Time is an important feature in many applications involving events that occur synchronously and/or asynchronously. To effectively consume time information, recent studies have focused on designing new architectures. In this paper, we take an orthogonal but complementary approach by providing a model-agnostic vector representation for time, called Time2Vec, that can be easily imported into many existing and future architectures and improve their performances. We show on a range of models and problems that replacing the notion of time with its Time2Vec representation improves the performance of the final model.},
